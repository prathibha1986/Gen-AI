USER STORY: As a biller, I want to have a link in the side menu of the Alleva Billing application that opens the insights reporting tool, so that I can directly access the Billing folder within Insights without needing to navigate through multiple pages.ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:A new menu item labeled Reports appears in the Billing application's left-side navigation menu, positioned above Settings.Clicking the Reports menu item opens a new tab and directs the user to the Billing folder within the Insights reporting tool.The link should retain any necessary authentication tokens or session context to allow direct access without requiring the user to log in again.The menu item is visible only to users with permission to access Insights. The iframe that is loaded should take user to dashboard https://alleva.looker.com/dashboards/3131"
